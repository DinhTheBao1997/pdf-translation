A healthy person lives in harmony with the microbial flora that helps protect its host from invasion by pathogens, usually defined as microorganisms that have the capacity to cause disease.
The microbial flora is mostly bacteria and fungi and includes normal resident flora, which is present consistently and which promptly reestablishes itself if disturbed, and transient flora, which may colonize the host for hours to weeks but does not permanently establish itself.
Organisms that are normal flora can occasionally cause disease, especially when defenses are disrupted.
Tropisms (attractions to certain tissues) determine which body sites microorganisms colonize.
Normal flora is influenced by tropisms and many other factors (eg, diet, hygiene, sanitary conditions, air pollution).
For example, lactobacilli are common in the intestines of people with a high intake of dairy products; Haemophilus influenzae colonizes the tracheobronchial tree in patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
As a result, different body habitats contain microbial communities, forming microbiomes that differ by microbial composition and function.
In severe gastritis, bleeding is managed with IV fluids and blood transfusion as needed.
Endoscopic hemostasis should be attempted, with surgery a fallback procedure if bleeding cannot be controlled endoscopically.
Angiography is unlikely to stop severe gastric bleeding because of the many collateral vessels supplying the stomach.
Acid-suppressing therapy should be started if the patient is not already receiving it.
For milder gastritis, removing the offending agent and using medications to reduce gastric acidity (see Medications for the Treatment of Gastric Acidity) to limit further injury and promote healing may be all that is required.
Prophylaxis with acid-suppressive medications can reduce the incidence of acute stress gastritis.
However, it mainly benefits certain high-risk intensive care unit patients, including those with severe burns, central nervous system trauma, coagulopathy, sepsis, shock, multiple trauma, mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours, chronic liver disease, acute kidney injury, hepatic or renal failure, multiorgan dysfunction, and history of peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding.
A 2020 guideline for gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis for critically ill patients recommends that in most critically ill patients the benefit of acid suppression must be weighed against the risk of pneumonia.
The guideline includes a calculator to help assess the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
There is a possible increased risk of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill patients receiving acid suppression.
A recent meta-analysis concluded that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists may increase the risk of pneumonia (absolute increases 5% for PPIs and 3.4% for histamine-2 receptor antagonists; 1).
However, a previous large clinical study of a PPI for patients at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in the intensive care unit found no increased incidence of pneumonia (2).
The guideline further recommends using a PPI rather than a histamine-2 receptor antagonist (weak recommendation) and recommends against using sucralfate.
Early enteral feeding also can decrease the incidence of bleeding.
Acid suppression is not recommended for patients simply taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs unless they have previously had an ulcer.
Acid is secreted by parietal cells in the proximal two thirds (body) of the stomach.
Gastric acid aids digestion by creating the optimal pH for pepsin and gastric lipase and by stimulating pancreatic bicarbonate secretion.
Acid secretion is initiated by food: the thought, smell, or taste of food effects vagal stimulation of the gastrin-secreting G cells located in the distal one third (antrum) of the stomach.
The arrival of protein to the stomach further stimulates gastrin output.
Circulating gastrin triggers the release of histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells in the body of the stomach.
Histamine stimulates the parietal cells via their H2 receptors.
The parietal cells secrete acid, and the resulting drop in pH causes the antral D cells to release somatostatin, which inhibits gastrin release (negative feedback control).
Acid secretion is present at birth and reaches adult levels (on a weight basis) by age 2.
There is a decline in acid output in older patients who develop chronic gastritis, but acid output is otherwise maintained throughout life.
Normally, the gastrointestinal mucosa is protected by several distinct mechanisms:
Mucosal production of mucus and HCO3 creates a pH gradient from the gastric lumen (low pH) to the mucosa (neutral pH).
The mucus serves as a barrier to the diffusion of acid and pepsin.
Epithelial cells remove excess hydrogen ions (H+) via membrane transport systems and have tight junctions, which prevent back diffusion of H+ ions.
Mucosal blood flow removes excess acid that has diffused across the epithelial layer.
Several growth factors (eg, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor I) and prostaglandins have been linked to mucosal repair and maintenance of mucosal integrity.
Factors that interfere with these mucosal defenses (particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and Helicobacter pylori infection) predispose to gastritis and peptic ulcer disease.
NSAIDs promote mucosal inflammation and ulcer formation (sometimes with gastrointestinal bleeding) both topically and systemically.
By inhibiting prostaglandin production via blockage of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), NSAIDs reduce gastric blood flow, reduce mucus and HCO3 secretion, and decrease cell repair and replication.
Also, because NSAIDs are weak acids and are nonionized at gastric pH, they diffuse freely across the mucus barrier into gastric epithelial cells, where H+ ions are liberated, leading to cellular damage.
Because gastric prostaglandin production involves the COX-1 isoform, NSAIDs that are selective COX-2 inhibitors have fewer adverse gastric effects than other NSAIDs.
Gastritis can be classified in several ways:
By severity of mucosal injury, as erosive gastritis or nonerosive gastritis
By the site of involvement (ie, cardia, body, antrum)
Histologically as acute or chronic (based on the inflammatory cell type)
No classification scheme matches perfectly with the pathophysiology; a large degree of overlap exists.
Some forms of gastritis involve acid peptic disease and H.
pylori disease (see also Overview of Acid Secretion).
Additionally, the term is often loosely applied to nonspecific (and often undiagnosed) abdominal discomfort and gastroenteritis.
Acute gastritis is characterized by polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration of the mucosa of the antrum and body.
