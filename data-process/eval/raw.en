A healthy person lives in harmony with the microbial flora that helps protect its host from invasion by pathogens, usually defined as microorganisms that have the capacity to cause disease.
The microbial flora is mostly bacteria and fungi and includes normal resident flora, which is present consistently and which promptly reestablishes itself if disturbed, and transient flora, which may colonize the host for hours to weeks but does not permanently establish itself.
Organisms that are normal flora can occasionally cause disease, especially when defenses are disrupted.
Tropisms (attractions to certain tissues) determine which body sites microorganisms colonize.
Normal flora is influenced by tropisms and many other factors (eg, diet, hygiene, sanitary conditions, air pollution).
For example, lactobacilli are common in the intestines of people with a high intake of dairy products; Haemophilus influenzae colonizes the tracheobronchial tree in patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
As a result, different body habitats contain microbial communities, forming microbiomes that differ by microbial composition and function.
In severe gastritis, bleeding is managed with IV fluids and blood transfusion as needed.
Endoscopic hemostasis should be attempted, with surgery a fallback procedure if bleeding cannot be controlled endoscopically.
Angiography is unlikely to stop severe gastric bleeding because of the many collateral vessels supplying the stomach.
Acid-suppressing therapy should be started if the patient is not already receiving it.
For milder gastritis, removing the offending agent and using medications to reduce gastric acidity (see Medications for the Treatment of Gastric Acidity) to limit further injury and promote healing may be all that is required.
Host defenses that protect against infection include
Natural barriers (eg, skin, mucous membranes)
Nonspecific immune responses (eg, phagocytic cells [neutrophils, macrophages] and their products)
Specific immune responses (eg, antibodies, lymphocytes)
The skin usually bars invading microorganisms unless it is physically disrupted (eg, by arthropod vectors, injury, IV catheters, surgical incision).
Exceptions include the following:
Human papillomavirus, which can invade normal skin, causing warts
The respiratory tract has upper airway filters.
If invading organisms reach the tracheobronchial tree, the mucociliary epithelium transports them away from the lung.
Coughing also helps remove organisms.
If the organisms reach the alveoli, alveolar macrophages and tissue histiocytes engulf them.
However, these defenses can be overcome by large numbers of organisms, by compromised effectiveness resulting from air pollutants (eg, cigarette smoke), interference with protective mechanisms (eg, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy), or by inborn defects (eg, cystic fibrosis).
Gastrointestinal tract barriers include the acid pH of the stomach and the antibacterial activity of pancreatic enzymes, bile, and intestinal secretions.
Compromised gastrointestinal defense mechanisms may predispose patients to particular infections (eg, achlorhydria predisposes to Salmonella, Campylobacter, and C. difficile infections).
If peristalsis is slowed (eg, because of drugs such as belladonna or opium alkaloids), this removal is delayed and prolongs some infections, such as symptomatic shigellosis and Clostridioides difficileâ€“induced colitis.
Compromised gastrointestinal defense mechanisms may predispose patients to particular infections (eg, achlorhydria predisposes to Salmonella, Campylobacter, and C. difficile infections).
Genitourinary tract barriers include the length of the urethra (20 cm) in men, the acid pH of the vagina in women, the hypertonic state of the kidney medulla, and the urine urea concentration.
The kidneys also produce and excrete large amounts of Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein, which binds certain bacteria, facilitating their harmless removal.
The complement system destroys cell walls of infecting organisms, usually through the classical pathway.
Complement can also be activated on the surface of some microorganisms via the alternative pathway.
Antibodies can also promote the deposition of substances known as opsonins (eg, the complement protein C3b) on the surface of microorganisms, which helps promote phagocytosis.
Opsonization is important for eradication of encapsulated organisms such as pneumococci and meningococci.
For many pathogens, the host's genetic make-up influences the host's susceptibility and the resulting morbidity and mortality.
For example, patients who have deficiencies of the terminal complement components (C5 through C8, perhaps C9) have an increased susceptibility to infections caused by neisserial species (eg, meningococcus, gonococcus).
